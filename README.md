# Assembly-4
This program takes a predefined, hardcoded array that has been stored in the stack and uses a binary search to determine whether or not the integer
the user is searching for is in the stack. The integers are already stored in the stack without the user's influence or reference (as I was told in office hours)
and the program will prompt the user for an int to search for. It then takes that value and continually searches the middle of the stack by calling its self
recursively until the value is found or the top or bottom of the stack is reached.
